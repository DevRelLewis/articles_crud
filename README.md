# Ruby Authenticator Program

## Overview

This is a simple command-line-based authenticator program written in Ruby. The program prompts the user for a username and password, then compares the input with predefined credentials. If the username and password match, the user is granted access; otherwise, the user is prompted to try again until the maximum number of attempts is reached.

## Features

- Accepts a username and password as input from the user.
- Compares the input to stored user credentials.
- Limits the number of login attempts (default is 3).
- Displays feedback based on the correctness of the input (accepted, incorrect, or too many attempts).

## Requirements

- Ruby installed on your machine (Check with: `ruby -v`)
- Basic knowledge of how to use a terminal/command-line interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `.rb` file containing the authenticator program.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `authenticator.rb` file is located.

## Running the Program

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the `authenticator.rb` file is stored:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```

2. Run the Ruby program with the following command:

   ```bash
   ruby authenticator.rb
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter your username and password. You have 3 attempts to enter the correct credentials.

## Usage

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter your username and password. Depending on the credentials you provide, the program will respond with one of the following:

- **Correct username and password**: Access is granted, and the program will exit.
- **Incorrect password**: You will be prompted to try again. You are allowed up to 3 attempts.
- **Maximum attempts reached**: The program will exit after displaying a message indicating that the maximum number of attempts has been reached.

## Example

```bash
Welcome to the Authenticator
-------------------------
This program will take input from the user and compare the password to the correct password.
If the password is correct, the user object will be returned.
Please enter your username:
> Lewis
Your username is correct.
Please enter your password:
> password1
Password accepted.
```
